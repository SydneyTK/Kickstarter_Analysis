# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns. 
## Project Overview 
### Background 
In order to help Louise maximize her revenues and run a successful crowd funding campaign to fund her new play Fever, extensive analysis was done on previous crowdfunding campaigns. With the goal of determining the specific attributes that make a successful campaign.  Before the analysis begins it is important to understand the project scope for Fever. Louise has prepared a budget which is allocated as follows and totals $10,693; $2,432 for the sets, $1,275 for costumes, $1,347 for props, $452 for makeup, $750 for lighting, $ 1,250 for rehearsal space, $725 for advertising, $230 for programs and $2,232 for actors.  
### Purpose 
Thankfully Louise raised almost all of the required funds within a short period of time. So further analysis will be done below to investigate how launch dates compare to fundraising goals. In the data provided some of the attributes which will be analyzed below are; the budgeted/ goal amount that needed to be raised by each campaign, the actual amount raised, the currency, the country the production took place in, the launch date, as well as the production type and subtype. 
## Analysis and Challanges 
### Method 
By utilizing excel many of the above listed attributes were tallied, compared and manipulated to understand how the launch date affects the fundraising goal. Some of the manipulation that took place was converting the Unix timestamps to a more readable date format, and extrapolating other pieces of data so they were not concatenated into one cell, for example making a column with just the year that each crowdfunding campaign took place, and separating the parent category and sub category into separate cells. Some of the tools used to complete this manipulation in excel was basic algebra, date functions, using text to columns and specifically the delimited function, and conditional formatting. Overall, the attributes were then compared to the outcome column. This comparison was shown in tables and graphs. A successful campaign or outcome was defined by one that raised more money than the goal amount. Failed, canceled and live were also other possible outcomes. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
By using a pivot table we were easily able to summaries the comparison of the launch date to the outcome. By utilizing the filters function this comparison could be further broken down by specifically looking at only one year, or one production type i.e. theater, film, music, photography, etc. We wanted to keep as many data points included so it was not filtered to one specific year, however we did manipulate the launch dates or rows to show by month. The parent category or production type was specifically narrowed down to theater as this is the most applicable production type for Louise.  
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals 
This analysis worked to answer the question; does the size of the production or funding goal have an influence on the success? By using a COUNTIF function we could set the thresholds or categories for production size, and then count the number of outcomes in each category or bracket. Once the number of successful, failed, and canceled projects were counted in each category we could easily calculate percentages using the SUM formula and ratios.   
### Challanges 
We needed to add columns as we were manipulating data, specifically when separating concatenated data. Whilst working through previous steps, and verifying or checking that functions and pivot tables worked, if filters were applied you needed to be conscious that any newly added columns would not have previous filters applied nor would new filters affect these new columns. As they were not in the original filter selection. At each deliverable completely clear the filters and reapply to the entire sheet. 
## Results 
### What are two conclusions you can draw about the outcomes based on launch date? 
The first conclusion is an obvious correlation between the season the play is launched in and its success. In the spring and summer months (April, May, June, July and August) the total number of plays released is higher than in the cooler months. Surprisingly the number of failed and especially canceled plays does not increase significantly along with the increased number of newly released productions. However, the number of successful plays does increase significantly with the increased number released. Allowing us to conclude that in the warmer summer months plays and funding are more successful.
Regardless of the season and month within the theater category there are consistently more successful productions, that were able to raise the funds required, than failed or canceled productions which were not. Consistently around 60% or more of the total productions are successful, with 3 months (January, August, and October) dropping to a still high but slightly less success rate of 58% or 56% and December dropping to 49%.

### What can you conclude about the outcomes based on goals? 
Of the goal categories outlined six of the budget categories had more successful productions and fundraising events than failed ones. Five budget categories had more productions fail than succeed. One budget category, the $15,000-$19,000, had an equal number of plays succeed and fail, and finally none of the plays were cancelled.  However, if you look at the lower budget categories, less than $1,000 to $ 15,000-$19,000, this is where the majority of productions fell and where the most were successful. At the other end of the data’s spectrum more expensive plays tended to fail more than succeed. Allowing us to conclude that your chances of success are higher on lower budget productions.

### Limitations
Some of the data provided seemed a little redundant and needed more context. For example column K was a Ture or False output with the headline Staff_Pick. Oddly only one production had a true output, but overall who are the staff and what are their credentials? And what is the criteria that they used to form their opinion and make their selection? Column M is labeled Spotlight with Ture and False outputs. None of the productions actually have a True spotlight outcome, but overall what does Spotlight mean? How could this piece of information help us analyze a successful crowdfunding campaign and if the launch date had any influence on the fundraising goal? Better data collection could have been done.  
### Future Analysis 
I would be curious to see more analysis done on the average donations’ column, and understand if there is a correlation between a higher average donation amount and the success or failure of reaching your crowdfunding goals. Is it advantageous to have one large investor when reaching your goals, or many little investors?  Does the number of investors depend on the category or production type?
